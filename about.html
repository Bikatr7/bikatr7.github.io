  <h2>Age</h2>
  <p>20</p>
  
  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>United States, Colorado</p>
  
  <h2>Coding Interests</h2>
  <p>I focus on a few key areas within my projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Translation, NER/NLP, and AI/LLM APIs:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bikatr7/kudasai" target="_blank">Kudasai</a> – A tool for translating and preprocessing Japanese text.</li>
    <li><strong>Japanese Learning:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bikatr7/seisen" target="_blank">Seisen</a> – An application designed to aid in learning the Japanese language.</li>
    <li><strong> Packages:</strong> Tools that assist my projects and hopefully others as well:<a href="https://github.com/bikatr7/kairyou" target="_blank">Kairyou: A Japanese preprocessor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bikatr7/EasyTL" target="_blank">EasyTL: A Wrapper of Translation APIs</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Interests Outside of Coding</h2>
  <p>I enjoy a variety of activities such as reading, biking, and translating.</p>
  
  <h2>Professional Goals</h2>
  <p>In the short-term, I aim to further develop my projects, so I and hopefully others can benefit from them. My long-term goal is to find a stable SWE job so I can pursue my passion of coding and make a living off of it.</p>
  
  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>I'm currently working towards earning my B.S. in Computer Science, with a focus on Cybersecurity. I am also pursuing a minor in Japanese. I'll be a Junior in the Fall, and I expect to graduate May of 2026.</p>
  
  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Proficient in Python, Java; familiar with C, R, C++, JavaScript</li>
    <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> MySQL, Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, Data Backup and Recovery, Database Security</li>
    <li><strong>Technologies & Frameworks:</strong> Git, OpenAI API, mysql-connector-python, DeepL API, discord.py, Gradio, SpaCy, Pillow</li>

    <li><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Effective Teamwork, Clear Communication, Problem-Solving, Leadership, Project Planning, Technical Documentation</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p>My professional journey is just beginning. Since January, I've honed my data analysis skills while working as a Teaching Assistant for an R programming class. I'm eager to translate these academic experiences into a technology internship, where I can contribute and grow further.</p>
